                shooting that jet with one accurate
                shoot from the shop. We can move
                ship forward or backward direction
                and can also change modes like day
                and night in game. It's fun game to
                play in free time.</dd> <br>
    
        <dt><b><u>GST-E-Billing App:</u></b></dt>
            <dd>This project is a application software
                designed for all type of companies to
                maintain the bills as per the recent
                trending of filing tax in the name of
                Goods and Service Tax (GST) by the
                new government.</dd> <br>

        <dt><b><u>Railway Track Crack Detection & Animal Entry Prevention System using IoT:</u></b></dt>
            <dd>This project inclues two sensors, one is IR sensor and the other one 
                is Fire sensor. IR sensor is used to detect the crack on the track 
                and also detects the animals or any obstacles. Fire sensor is used
                to detect the fire accidents. Once the fire is sensed, he buzzer 
                beeps and the water sprinkler gets activated and also detachment of 
                compartment takes place simultaneously. If all of these are detected 
                then the information is sent as an SMS to the pre-registered railway 
                authority through using Wi-Fi module through telegram app.</dd>
